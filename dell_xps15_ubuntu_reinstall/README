When reinstalling Ubuntu on the Dell XPS 15 via USB drive, GRUB does not
acknowledge the drive in the boot menu. The options given are something like
this:

Ubuntu
Advanced options for Ubuntu
Memory test (memtest86+)
Memory test (memtest86+, serial console 115200)

To actually boot from the USB drive, you need to go into the GRUB CLI (press 'c'
at the above screen), and execute the following commands:

grub> set root=(hd1,msdos1)
grub> chainloader +1
grub> boot

where you replace (hd1,msdos1) with the name of the USB drive. You can determine
this by removing the drive and entering:

grub> ls

Then reinsert the drive and enter `ls` again. The name of the USB drive will be
the name that was not present before.
